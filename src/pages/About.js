        A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails are
        either a combination of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other
        ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. Cocktails
        vary widely across regions of the world, and many websites publish both
        original recipes and their own interpretations of older and more famous
        cocktails.

        The origins of the word cocktail have been debated. The first written
        mention of cocktail as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803
        in the United States. The first definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic
        beverage appeared three years later in The Balance and Columbian
        Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally, cocktail
        ingredients included spirits, sugar, water and bitters, however, this
        definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to include the addition of a
        liqueur.

        In the modern world and the Information Age, cocktail recipes are widely
        shared online on websites. Cocktails and restaurants that serve them are
        frequently covered and reviewed in tourism magazines and guides. Some
        cocktails, such as the Mojito, Manhattan, and Martini have become both
        staples in most restaurants and pop culture phenomena, martinis
        specifically being associated with James Bond due to his phrase "shaken,
        not stirred".
